# 🛡️ Margin Guardian | Paradox Engine Finance Module

**Margin Guardian** is a high-precision risk management tool designed for leveraged trading environments. It calculates the mathematical impact of **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)** on liquidation prices and PnL (Profit and Loss) in real-time.

### 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Position Rescuing:** Calculate exactly how much margin is needed to move your liquidation price to a safe zone.
* **Average Entry Calibration:** Real-time updates on your new entry price after adding margin at specific price points.
* **Risk Sensitivity Analysis:** Visualizes the percentage gap between the current price and the liquidation threshold.

### 🧪 Scientific Methodology
